# Auto Ricing i3 Script

This script is in progress. The Arch version should work very well (as long as you do not have i3 installed or have a previous i3 config folder). The Ubuntu version is a bit broken for now until I make some changes to the config or figure out how to build i3-gaps on Ubuntu.

Documentation will come soon ish.
